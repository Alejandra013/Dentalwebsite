    <p>The practice of maintaining good oral hygiene habits prevent dental disorders as well 
       as bad breath and can prevent the need for deep cleaning and the usage of anesthesia. 
       The United States has problems with oral health. While most Americans' oral health has
       improved markedly over 60 years, many millions are left behind and hurting. Societal 
       improvements in science, technology, education, hygiene,community water fluoridation, 
       and school-based services have not been broadly shared. Today 130 million Americans,
       primarily adults, have no dental coverage (Mcdonough 720). Millions of Americans fail 
       to see a dentist each year,despite how regular dental examinations and good oral hygiene 
       can prevent most dental diseases. It is a common misconception that people need to see a 
       dentist only if they are in pain or think something is wrong, but regular dental visits 
       can contribute to a lifetime of good oral health.
