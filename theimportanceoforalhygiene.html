    <h1>What Can Happen</h1>
    <p>Without proper oral hygiene, bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections, such as tooth decay and gum disease.Most people know that not brushing 
        your teeth daily can lead to cavities, bad breath and tooth decay. But recent studies find that poor dental hygiene can also have unexpected health consequences, such as increased risks for Alzheimer's disease and heart disease.For many in people in the past this has sadly been the case, as progressive diseases, such as tooth decay and gum disease, typically manifest slowly over an extended period, and rarely display any obvious symptoms until they reach their advanced stages. If these illnesses have progressed to a later stage, the damage at that point may be irreversible and could in fact, trigger a litany of additional health problems as well! Whether it be gum disease, tooth decay, or other health complications.
        This can potentially lead to other health conditions f the bacteria produced by either condition can enter the bloodstream, it may likely travel to other areas of the body, thereby spreading and worsening the infection. If the infectious bacteria reach the heart of its host, it will inflame the heartâ€™s vessels, resulting in the formation of numerous blood clots. These blood clots will slowly begin to cut off the flow of blood, ultimately strangling the heart and forcing it to pump faster while producing less.

    <h1>Conditions Linked to Oral Disease</h1>  
   
    <p>Endocarditis. This infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers or valves (endocardium) typically occurs when bacteria or other germs from another part of your body, such as your mouth, spread through your bloodstream and attach to certain areas in your heart.
        Cardiovascular disease. Although the connection is not fully understood, some research suggests that heart disease, clogged arteries and stroke might be linked to the inflammation and infections that oral bacteria can cause.
        Pregnancy and birth complications. Periodontitis has been linked to premature birth and low birth weight.
        Pneumonia. Certain bacteria in your mouth can be pulled into your lungs, causing pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.</p>

        <h1>Preventing Oral Disease & Protecting Oral Health</h1>
        <p>Brush your teeth at least twice a day for two minutes each time. Use a soft-bristled brush and fluoride toothpaste.
            Floss daily.
            Use mouthwash to remove food particles left after brushing and flossing.
            Eat a healthy diet and limit sugary food and drinks.
            Replace your toothbrush every three to four months, or sooner if bristles are splayed or worn.
            Schedule regular dental checkups and cleanings.
            Avoid tobacco use.
            Also, contact your dentist as soon as an oral health problem arises. Taking care of your oral health is an investment in your overall health.</p>
